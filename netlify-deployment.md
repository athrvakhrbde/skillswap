# Deploying SkillSwap to Netlify

This guide will walk you through deploying your SkillSwap application to Netlify.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository with your SkillSwap code
- A Netlify account (sign up at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) if you don't have one)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Your Code to GitHub

Before deploying to Netlify, make sure your code is pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Netlify deployment"
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Connect to Netlify

1. Log in to your Netlify account
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
4. Authenticate with GitHub if prompted
5. Select your SkillSwap repository

### 3. Configure Build Settings

Netlify should automatically detect that this is a Next.js project, but ensure these settings:

- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `.next`

The `netlify.toml` file in your repository should handle these settings automatically.

### 4. Advanced Settings (Optional)

You can configure additional settings:

- **Environment variables**: Add any environment variables your app needs
- **Domain settings**: Set up a custom domain for your application
- **Build hooks**: Configure automatic deployments when you push to GitHub

### 5. Deploy

Click "Deploy site" and wait for the build to complete. Netlify will provide you with a URL where your site is hosted (e.g., `https://skillswap-yourname.netlify.app`).

## Post-Deployment

After deployment, you can:

- Set up a custom domain
- Enable HTTPS
- Configure form handling
- Set up redirects and rewrites
- Monitor site analytics

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with your deployment:

1. Check the build logs in Netlify for errors
2. Ensure the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` package is installed
3. Verify your `netlify.toml` configuration is correct
4. Test your build locally with `npm run build` to ensure it compiles correctly

## Local Testing

To test the Netlify build process locally before deploying:

1. Install the Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Run `netlify build` to test the build process
3. Run `netlify dev` to test your site locally with Netlify's environment

## Automatic Deployments

Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy your site when you push changes to your GitHub repository. No additional configuration is required for this feature.
